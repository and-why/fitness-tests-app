          <h3>Cardiovasular Tests</h3>
          <h4>3 Minute Step Test</h4>
          <p>The step test is a great way to give you an estimate of a client’s aerobic capacity. All you need is a 30cm high step. You could use anything from a sturdy box to a concrete step.</p>
          <p>Have your client step up and down the step in the pattern left leg up, right leg up, left leg down, right leg down, and so on. Do this at a steady pace, using a metronome to maintain the pace throughout. After 3 minutes, have the client stop and then calculate their heart rate for 1 minute.  The lower the number of beats in that minute, the better. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Beep Test: 20m Shuttle Run Test</h4>
          <p>If you want a test that will give you an estimated VO2 Max, the beep test is your test. It is widely popular and is used by many sports teams and fitness fanatics alike. There’s a good chance you’ve done one of these at some point in your life.</p>
          <p>To carry out this test, you’ll need cones, a tape measure and a CD player/Smart Phone. Find an area with 20m of space, the place the cones 20m apart. Download a beep test app, or purchase a beep test CD and have your client run from cone to cone in time to the beeps. Not too fast, but also not too slow.</p>
          <p>As time goes on, the time between beeps decreases, meaning the client needs to up their speed. Eventually they will get to the point where they are running at their aerobic capacity and shortly after they will no longer be able to make it to the end before the beep. The last beep they completed successfully will be their score. The score is recorded as the level and number of shuttles they complete at that level. For example: level 11, 10 shuttles.</p>
          <p>Most good beep test apps will tell you the level and shuttle number after every beep, so you’ll know what they achieved.</p>
          <p>You can then use a formula to estimate their VO2 Max:</p>
          <p>3.46 * (L + SN / (L * 0.4325 + 7.0048)) + 12.2 </p>
          <p>Where: L = Level, SN = Number of Shuttle at that level</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Maximum Push Up Test</h4>
          <p>This test is great for testing the strength and muscular endurance of the chest, arms and shoulders to some degree. The premise is very simple; you get your client to perform as many push ups us possible until failure, that means until they can no longer carry out another push up. It’s important to make sure that their technique doesn’t suffer, and if it does, get them to maintain correct technique else the repetition doesn’t count.</p>
          <p>The client can do this either on their toes, or if that is too difficult, they can modify by carrying out the test on their knees.</p>
          <p>Tip: You can do this test with any bodyweight exercise, as it’ll give you a guide as to progress for those muscles against your clients’ current body weight. These could include bodyweight squats, being good to measure your lower body strength and muscular endurance, and also pull-ups for back and arms to complete the set.</p>
          </div>
          <h4>Plank Test</h4>
          <p>The plank test is another way to test muscular endurance for the core. It is a very simple yet gruelling test. Have your client assume the plank position, with shoulders in line with, or slightly behind, their biceps. Make sure they have a neutral spine (flat back), and straight alignment through knees, hips and shoulders. They have to hold this plank until failure, so holding it for as long as physically possible. If their technique slips, or their hips dip lower, give them a warning. If it continues to suffer, end the test and record the time.</p>
          <h4>Curl Up Test</h4>
          <p>The Curl Test is a great way to test the muscular endurance of the core. Have your client carry out as many crunches as possible in 60 seconds, whilst maintaining good technique. If 60 seconds is too long, try starting with 30 seconds.</p>
          <p>The client lies on their back on a mat. You can hold their feet or not, just make sure you make a note of it, as you’ll need to make sure you do the same next time. Client then does as many crunches as possible within the time limit.</p>
